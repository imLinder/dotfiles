DOTFILES
========

My personal dotfiles

Managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

### Ctrl-w everywhere

Add `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` with

```
{
    "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:";
}
```

## Todo

- Add https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary
- Automate install/sync of DefaultKeyBinding.dict
