## Manually install (or automate)

### Ctrl-w everywhere

Add `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` with

```
{
    "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:";
}
```

## Todo

* Add WeeChat configs
* Better build/symlink-script to allow selection of configs. E.g. `.Xresources`
  only on linux.
* Install instructions.
